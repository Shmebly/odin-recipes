    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep.</strong>Preheat the oven to 350ºF. 
        Prepare two 9-inch cake pans by spraying
        them with baking spray or buttering and lightly flouring them.</li>

        <p><li><strong>Whisk dry ingredients.</strong> Add flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, salt 
        and espresso powder to a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer and whisk.</li></p>

        <p><li><strong>Mix in wet ingredients.</strong> Add milk, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla to flour mixture 
        and mix together on medium speed until well combined. Reduce speed 
        and carefully add boiling water to the cake batter until well combined.</li></p>

        <p><li><strong>Bake.</strong> Distribute cake batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans. 
        Bake for 30-35 minutes, until a toothpick or cake tester 
        inserted in the center of the chocolate cake comes out clean.</li></p>

        <p><li><strong>Frost.</strong> Remove from the oven and allow to cool for about 10 minutes, 
        remove from the pan and cool completely. Frost with <a href="https://addapinch.com/perfect-chocolate-buttercream-frosting-recipe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chocolate Buttercream Frosting.</a></li></p>
